Once upon a time, there was a dragon that flew in the skies. His name was Griffy, and he was pretty happy all the time. "Why am I so happy all the time?" Griffy asked himself often. However, he was not complaining about being happy all the time, because he knew it was better than being sad all the time. Griffy often uses his ability to fly to take kids on magical rides in the sky. What makes Griffy so happy is making others happy.
